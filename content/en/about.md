Hi! I'm **Giacomo Di Clerico**, a passionate **Computer Engineering student** at **Politecnico di Milano**.

I’m fascinated by the world of **Linux**, **networking**, and **cybersecurity** areas where technology meets creativity and precision. In my spare time, I enjoy experimenting in my **homelab**, where I design and manage self-hosted environments to explore **virtualization**, **automation**, and **system administration**.

I’m particularly drawn to **digital security**, focusing on **threat analysis**, **system hardening**, and building **resilient infrastructures** to protect data and privacy.

My goal is to constantly **learn**, **create**, and **share** knowledge, contributing to the open-source community and connecting with people who share the same enthusiasm for technology.
