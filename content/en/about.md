Hi! 👋 I'm **Giacomo Di Clerico**, a passionate Computer Engineering student at **Politecnico di Milano**.

I’m deeply interested in **Linux** and love experimenting within my own **homelab**, designing and managing self-hosted environments where I explore **networking**, **server administration**, and **virtualization**.  

Fascinated by **cybersecurity**, I dedicate my time to learning about **threat analysis**, **system hardening**, and building **secure infrastructures** to protect critical data.

I’m always curious and motivated to **learn**, **experiment**, and **connect** with fellow tech enthusiasts who share the same drive for open-source technologies and digital security.
